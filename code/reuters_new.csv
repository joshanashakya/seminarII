1,"USDA REPORTS 10.572 MLN ACRES IN CONSERVATION The U.S. Agriculture Department has accepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.     In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.     The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.     Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with permanent vegetative cover.     Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn ""bonus"" rental payment that was offered by USDA.     The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based accepted into the reserve.     The state showing the biggest enrollment in the conservation program during this signup was Texas with approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and Kansas with 842,000 acres.     Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with 646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraska with 554,000 acres.     In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana, 217,000 acres and 116,000 acres respectively were enrolled.     Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program totals 19,488,587 acres. Bids on the previous signups ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 45.52 dlrs.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
2,"CBT TRADERS SAY U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP NEUTRAL The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of 10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain and soybean prices Monday, grain traders said.     Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin new crop futures, they said.     New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest decrease in final production figures, since farmers will concentrate on high yielding land.     Of a total 11,254,837 erodoble acres submitted, usda accepted 10,572,402 acres into the program at an average rental payment of 51.17 dlrs per acre.

3,"U.S. COTTON CERTIFICATE EXPIRATION DATE EXTENDED Expiration dates on upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are being extended, the Agriculture Department announced.     The certificates are being extended because of a shortage of Commodity Credit Corporation inventory available for exchange with certificates, USDA undersecretary Danial Amstutz said.     Presently, upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine months from the last day of the month of issuance.     Under the new procedure, all current outstanding and all new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program will have an expiration date of either February 29, 1988, or nine months from the last day of the month in which the certificate is issued, whichever is later.

5,"U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact.     ""Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for,"" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said.     The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.     Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31.     Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.     Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities, said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures. ""The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing,"" he added.     The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the enrollment figures.     Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures.     Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring, he said: ""The trade was definitely looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than expected.""     The USDA offered a special corn ""bonus"" rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve.     Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures.     ""I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the long run,"" she said.     Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or the latest addition.     ""It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program,"" she said.     Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60's.     Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres.     New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program, despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures.

6,"TANZANIA WANTS TO EXPORT 200,000 TONNES OF MAIZE Tanzania seeks to export a surplus of 200,000 tonnes of maize from last year's bumper harvest, agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday.     The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2.1 mln tonnes, but only a fraction of this was marketed, with most grain consumed by the farmers who grew it.     The state-owned National Milling Corp (NMC) meanwhile said it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in different parts of the country.     NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity, concentrated in Dar es Salaam, Arusha in the north and Iringa in central Tanzania.     In addition, the country has 450,000 tonnes of flat storage capacity, he added.

The Trade Ministry said rice imports quadrupled in local currency value during the first nine months of last year as the government established a buffer stock of the country's staple food.

8,"ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS STALL ON FOOD SUBSIDIES Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said.     The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them.     President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots.     The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances.     The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.     The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.     The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months, but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar.     Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.

10,"U.S. SOY PRODUCERS THINK EC OILS TAX UNLIKELY American soybean producers are confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said.     Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at a lunch.     After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.     ""Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"" he said.     ""The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it once and for all,"" Bennett added.     Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S. Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he said.     The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.     U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion dlrs a year, Bennett said.     The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax, he added.     The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.     ""We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures,"" Bennett said.     ""The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist, and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,"" he added.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,1,0
11,"AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92 A 0/92 program would have very little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according to a report from the Agriculture Department.     The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.     The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92 acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley. Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.     ""The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small,"" the report said.     ""The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage,"" the USDA report said.     The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment, would be most used by producers in high production/high risk areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins, director of USDA's economics analysis staff.     ""In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much participation,"" Collins said.     USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.     Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of cotton, the report said.     ""In determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered,"" according to the analysis.     ""What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production,"" Collins said.     For producers with low production costs, that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said. Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more attractive.     Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.     ""I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments,"" Collins said.     In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month.

Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeutter said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.     Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in Canadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, a lower-level U.S. trade official said.

Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the non-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavy enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.

18,"SOYBEAN GROUPS MEET WITH LYNG TO DISCUSS LOAN A high-level meeting last week which included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDA officials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying groups, failed to reach any decision on what should be done about the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting told Reuters.     ""We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but we were delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't close the door on anything,"" a member of the soybean delegation said.     At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at the present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman reductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making soybeans more profitable to grow than corn.     But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in relation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their support to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers.     Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, but participants would not reveal what those options were.     ""There were no surprises in our package,"" one participant said. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates.     The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with 77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.     This would have the effect of lowering the world price, maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the government's soybean inventory.     A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last week's meeting, participants said.     One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting was a ""listening session"" for USDA, and that the proposals will now be studied further by the Department.     USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time frame. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in the soybean loan to be announced in the near future.

19,"ZIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65 pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural industry sources said.     They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.     Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food shortage in Zimbabwe.     While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000 tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes, which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.     The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from 248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

10,"IVORY COAST WEATHER NO PROBLEM FOR 1986/87 CROPS Ivory Coast rainfall this season has been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily Fraternite Matin reported.     The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop. Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if there is good rainfall in coming weeks.     Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin said.     Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes, compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have been affected in some regions, it added.     London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast 1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes, which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described early development of the new main crop as patchy.     The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's 4.33 mln bag harvest.     Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee crop as ""normal.""  REUTER &#3;",0,1,0,0,0

13,"INDIA RELAXES RULES FOR EXPORT PROMOTION The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual export earnings for export promotion abroad.     The move is designed by the government to improve India's trade deficit.     Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.     The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.     RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings.     These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil, psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.     RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.     Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three days,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to above normal moisture this week.""     Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.     Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.     Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.     ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a pretty good rain,"" Mohler said.     Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off 19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.     Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage in early July, he said.

Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn.     Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations.

16,"PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS Pakistani government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.     Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products.         Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s.     But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders.     The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market, he said.         Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but reviewed every year.     It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period.     He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms.         Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23 billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.     He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls.     ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports, specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports.""         He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed from import restrictions.     Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.  Reuter &#3;",0,1,1,0,0
1,"ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said.     Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died.     That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.     However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF.     ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
2,"FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.     They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.     However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.     Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.     There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.     Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean.     However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.     Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.     The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln.     Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.     Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.     Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously.     This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes.     Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.     Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April.     The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.     The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop.     The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86.     The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.     Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,1,1

Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.     He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems.     Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop.     But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.     The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity.     Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space.     In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said.     Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops.     The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,1,0

India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31, 1990.     Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with good weather, the report said.     ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be vigrously pursued,"" it said.

The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.     It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.     However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said.     The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said.     Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said.     Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested.     During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said.     New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,1,1

44,"SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.     In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month.     USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising"" because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.     All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn, USDA said.     Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12 mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.     USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.     The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill,"" USDA said.     Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently.     USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

3,"U.S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW U.S. corn acreage this year is  likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years, Agriculture Department officials said.     USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31. Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres, down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.     Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels.     Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain analysts said.     ""There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage,"" one said. ""It's difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year.""     Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.     Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.     If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.     Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2 billion bushels.     Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.     ""This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production,"" an analyst said.     A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S. corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not increase significantly, a specialist said.     High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical participation in government programs, analysts said.     In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.     ""Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"" he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas.     Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's 2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.     U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has steadily declined in the 1980's.     U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.     Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.     ""We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,"" an analyst said.     Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts said.     Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage.     ""To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to provide more incentives,"" an analyst said.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,1,0

8,"U.S. SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF-DESTRUCT, CONGRESSMAN A leading U.S. farm-state Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.     ""We're moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program),"" Rep. Huckaby, chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told Reuters in an interview.     Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.     Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.     ""I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point where the program might not work,"" he said.     ""Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,"" said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.     A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.     A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.     ""I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),"" Huckaby said.     However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.     He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U.S.     But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.     Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.     ""This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved,"" Huckaby said.     Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.     Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production.     ""I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do that legally?"" he said.     Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said ""You build a fragile house if you do it that way.""     Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain.     But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy.     Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year.     Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program.     ""The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't think it will get up a head of steam,"" Huckaby said.     He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved.     Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program, Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
9,"ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87 soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April, trade sources said.     They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February.     The new forecast is still higher than last season's record total production.     Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1 mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.     Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires.     The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86 record of 3.34 mln hectares.     The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.     Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.     The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts.     In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.     The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.     The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares in 1985/86.     The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.     This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.     The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.     A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields.     The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.     Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln tonnes.     The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.     The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.     Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to 22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,1,0
10,"LOWER U.S. SOYBEAN LOAN IDEA SHARPLY CRITICIZED U.S. soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S. soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per bushel next year.     ""I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening. Politically it would be totally unacceptable,"" an aide to a senior farm-state senator said.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.     ""I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,"" American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.     Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.     His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the administration's position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers' income.     Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move would be too costly.     ""There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz proposal,"" said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.     ""Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan,"" O'Conner said.     Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or 4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.

11,"COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS Congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.     The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said.     USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said.     The issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending.     Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.     Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp, CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.     USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage.     It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs, Reagan administration sources said.     The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold.     The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates.     The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash.     Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987, according to USDA.     Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate.     Eliminating this practice, called ""PIK and roll,"" would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.     The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives.     The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said.     However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.     The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year.     USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.     Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained by Reuters.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0

13,"IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD The International Wheat Council (IWC) lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.     In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.     The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.     The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.     At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.     Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise.     After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987, the IWC said.     Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC said.     It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at end&#127;of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.     After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

14,"IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its latest monthly report.     Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.     In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production.     A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.     The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries.     They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.     Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period.     This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said.     The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production.     The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.     These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.     For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says.     The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to increased production in China and India.     The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower acreages.     In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S. Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

They said last week's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.     However, it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later.     The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.

Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes, depending on the state of the market.

13,"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S. Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said.     ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named, said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market,"" he said.     Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers.     Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.     Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31.     Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.     U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.     An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business.     The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.     To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products.     But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.     ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official said.  REUTER &#3;",1,0,1,1,0
14,"MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.     Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said.     The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year.     Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told Reuters.     The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.     The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.     The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.     In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks.     They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.

3,"LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA Rising demand for U.S. rice may gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the 1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on July 31.     Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year, the report said.     USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off.     With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate, USDA said.     ""Development of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers,"" USDA said.     USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U.S.     ""The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa,"" the report said.     World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes, increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains.     China, India and South Korea have increased output, while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid-1970s, the report said.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,1,0,0

In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.     However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife.     Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop, it said.     However, may developing countries in tropical climates, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the department said.     World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986/87 for the third straight year.

2,"U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA The U.S. Agriculture Department  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments.     In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the ""Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987"", Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.     Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.     The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill.     Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.     The direct payment plan outlined by the administration  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.     For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.     The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.     Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.     He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads.     U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a ""progressive contraction"" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.     Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.     USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar.

Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record 16.15 mln in 1982.     The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy. It did not give the context of his remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from 391 mln in 1986.     The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where ""pigs are not fed, there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed.""

5,"BEGHIN-SAY INCREASES CAPITAL TO FINANCE EXPANSION French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is 49.6 pct owned by Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise its capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one issue of shares and investment certificates to finance expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts.     For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.     The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans. These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes said.     Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark.     Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes said.     If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants, either in the maize or wheat starch sector.     Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its capital increase.     Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year, has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future.  REUTER &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
6,"AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL, FORECASTER SAYS Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast.     But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.     Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.     The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said.     Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops.     ""The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers' income,"" AWF said.

Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's Agriculture Development Department, told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.     Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the ""belg"" (small) rains which fall at this time of year.     The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their stocks of seed.     Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains.     The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0

Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel.     The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.

9,"PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders.     Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders.     Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.     As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.     Barreto said, ""My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part."" He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.     Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.     ""There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,"" Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.     The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

10,"U.S. FARM POLICY DEBATE COULD HIT SENATE SOON The Senate this week might take up proposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to expose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy.     The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income support payments if flooding last year prevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987 crops, Senate staff members told Reuters.     Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy.     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting requirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and rice producers, an aide said.     Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their deficiency payments.     Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to budget-cutting pressures.     Representatives of these farm groups have said they also fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a bill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for sharply higher support prices.

Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.     All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries.     The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.     They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports.

12,"1987 U.S. SOYBEAN LOAN SHOULD STAY SAME-AMSTUTZ Congress should give the U.S. Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.     Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program ""dilemma"" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate.     Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu.     Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.     The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.     Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs.     He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an ""umbrella"" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.     Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for some form of income support, Amstutz said ""the competitive problem is the most severe.""

""There sometimes is a difference between being competitive and being cheap,"" Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing.     Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and Washington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offered on wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheat price was competitive or cheap.     ""I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore this issue as it pertains to competitiveness,"" Amstutz said.

Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction between competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate.

Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal throughout all grain areas, stressing grain-filling corn in areas receiving lightest rainfall, it said.     The agency said rainfall during February was near to above normal in most areas, but earlier periods of hot, dry weather reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and southern Orange Free State.

10,"WORLD CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA Dry weather covered most European crop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those in southwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.     In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agency said mixed rain and snow covered Greece.     Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italy remained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.     Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in early April, it said.     Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas of northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.     Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central India and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas by late April.     Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India, reversing February's below-normal trend.     Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most southern areas, it said.     In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to the central islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzon and southern Mindanao.     Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.     In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding in Java, it said.     The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccan winter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said.     Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in Southeast Asia.     Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and central Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet crop demands, it said.     Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintained adequate moisture for crop growth, it said.     Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks as winter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase, the agency said.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,1,0,1
11,"U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant.     The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.     Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S. Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.     USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed broad-scale revision of farm programs.     The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received.     To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring, although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay.     USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs, largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.     The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall's flooding.     In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall.     Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.     The administration said it opposed the bill because, by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance.     USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings.     USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs.     USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs.     In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.     But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

14,"U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES From April through December 1986, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January-August, 1987.     These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.     Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain more competitive on world markets, it said.     The department said last summer, for example, certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise.     The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels, it said.     The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.     During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force, annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.     The department said the President's budget proposals for 1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs.     In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct average of 1980-86, it said.     Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years, the department said.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,1

Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator for USDA's state and county operations, said the following changes are under consideration by USDA.     Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.     Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.     Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.     VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.

Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee, Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and should also include the Soviet Union.     Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan administration recently because Secretary of State George Shultz was out of the country.     ""That very well may be the case,"" said Tom Kay, U.S. Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.     Rep.

""He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk about an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to the Soviet Union,"" said Glen Hofer, vice president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.

Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting.     Hofer described Lyng as ""sympathetic but noncommittal,"" and said he thought he detected ""a sense of frustration"" on Lyng's part at not being able to respond more positively to the group's urging.     A grain industry representative said some participants were ""puzzled"" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.     ""There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,"" this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.

23,"U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.     Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.     By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales, where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed.     If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the Gulf corn basis.     ""The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices,"" one dealer said. ""It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,"" which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest.     ""But we don't know when they might do it,"" an Ohio dealer said, which has created uncertainty in the market.     The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage.     Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date been exchanged for grain.     With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.     A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals, cash dealers said.     Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.     The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings, they said.     ""The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"" which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader said.     But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside, freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
24,"HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS The 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.     Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending, said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.     Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.     Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget, Glickman added.     Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's  proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.     ""The administration's target price proposals are dead in the water,"" he said.     To cut the budget, Glickman said, ""everthing is on the table,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.     Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending.     Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.     Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or ""pik') certificates will also be another option his committee will study, Glickman said.     While not committing himself for or against such action, he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.     Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.     He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would not be in favor of such a change.     Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's, EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas.     Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.     ""I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block,"" Glickman said.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

29,"ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February.     But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7 pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures, and would be a new record.     The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.     The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province.     The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty, especially in Cordoba.     Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.     Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.     With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize, sunflower and sorghum harvesting.     Crops were considered in generally good condition, though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage.     The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.     Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.     Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest, according to official figures.     The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.     Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record 3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     The current harvest's volume was again expected to be between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.     Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and, consequently, on total production volume.     The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.     Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and 1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.

The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S. officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the U.S.     ""Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market,"" said one U.S. source.         The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential.     But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.     Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not narrow the differential further for 1987/88.     As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.

6,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange.     Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.     Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).     ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading.     One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports.     However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said.     Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.     However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.     Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86.     Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.     The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year.     But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.     One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering.     The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.     ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible.     ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade official said.     Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said.     Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.     In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said.     ""We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"" he added.     Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.     But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added.     ""It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced,"" one trade source said. ""The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants.""     Another added, ""Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty.     ""This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy.""  REUTER &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

16,"ANALYSTS PEG U.S. COTTON SEEDINGS 10.6 MLN ACRES U.S. cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting intentions report next Tuesday.     The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1.     Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to 10.9 mln acres.     On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres.     Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.     Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop.     ""With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton. Soybeans are dirt cheap,"" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists.     Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to increased acreage, analysts said.     They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government will not pick up the tab for storage.     Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program, which could result in more cotton. ""The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of 25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,"" noted Judy Weissman of Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage  they have.     Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program. ""Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,"" said one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its annual meeting in late January.     But others disagreed. ""I think some Western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons. There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the program is subject to the wiles of the market,"" said Walter Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.     Some cotton specialists said their expectations for increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting intentions report. ""Anything the USDA is announcing now is based on information they gathered before their cotton program was announced (on March 20),"" one analyst cautioned. She said traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.     Brown took that opinion a step further. ""I don't think planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment rate,"" the difference between acreage planted and acreage harvested.     Brown said the abandonment rate this year was ""pretty high"" at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing states. ""More normal would be about six pct,"" he said.  Reuter &#3;",0,1,0,0,0
17,"COLD AIR A THREAT TO SOME U.S. HARD WHEAT AREAS A cold air mass working its way south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red winter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.     ""There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along so that it's probably vulnerable,"" Krenzler said.     Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the system.     If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.     Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.     ""We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26 degrees (fahrenheit),"" Krenzler said, ""as long as we don't have a lot of wind.""     ""If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we have a good chance of significant damage to the heads,"" he said.     Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable. Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three-month shipment period.     ""Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline sharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish summer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seen continuing five to seven months from April,"" one source said.     The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering a total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May to October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most of the corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price rises in the world market.     Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/September is still uncertain. But the sources forecast supplies from Argentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from an anticipated 800,000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light of tighter export availability.

Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics show.     The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S. Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near term due to labour problems there.     The Japanese purchases comprise 30,000 tonnes for April 20/May 10 shipment, 102,000 for May, 15,000 for late May/early June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July shipment, the sources said.     As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000 tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment.

20,"SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.     Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.     The letter said the government had to step in ""to avert serious economic hardship"" and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.     The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.     In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completely devastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally expected.     There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks.     ""Should the present drought continue, however, production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added.     Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.     The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed.     It said the government's current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected. ""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side.""     The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family, as well as handling, transport and distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation"" in the economy, the letter said.     The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replaced subsequently.""     The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May.     The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August, and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,1,0,1

Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero last year from 300,000 tonnes in 1985, while maize sales fell to 15,000 tonnes from 994,000, official EC statistics show.     The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and the U.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum each year for the next four years.     But they said various details of this accord will tend to inhibit imports from Argentina.     These include a provision for reduction of the amounts if Spain imports cereals substitutes, and the EC's plan to import the special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis.

9,"TOP NATIONS AGREE OVER FARM TRADE ISSUE Ministers from the major trading nations have for the first time made a concerted commitment to review the whole distorted structure of world farm trade, Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said.     ""We think we can get some movement on this,"" she told reporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S., Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here.     Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed the cause of both developed and developing nations which have seen their farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war between the United States and the EC.     Japan""s protected agricultural markets have also attracted criticism.     The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted, developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farm sector exports to sustain their economies but which cannot compete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products.     ""Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so), but many countries cannot,"" said Carney.     She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude and had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under which to discuss the issue.     Talks will now continue at the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which meets next month, and at the series of discussions on a new world trading framework, begun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year.     Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive role in the farm talks, and that the United States was willing to see short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions were not affected.     Canada""s five point programme demands that farm product prices must reflect open world market prices, that any support for farmers incomes should not be linked to production incentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no new farm import barriers, and that any decisions should be implemented collectively.     The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the industrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the Tokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers.     The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism have created some absurd situations.     For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese government buys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase price to Japanese consumers.     ""So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) market to help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make a profit on our wheat to help pay the price support for their farmers,"" said Carney.     The problem causes pain for many nations and increases the already dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S., Japanese and EC banks.  REUTER &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

Montri told reporters he will seek a meeting with U.S. Ambassador William Brown to determine why the U.S. Failed to set its weekly rice prices in accordance with rising world prices during the period.     He said the U.S. Has followed a policy of weakening world rice prices by announcing highly subsidised export prices lower than those quoted by Thai traders.     Thai officials said weekly rice prices as announced by the U.S. Agriculture Department were unchanged for 11 weeks up to April 8.     Thailand, a major rice exporter, has criticised the U.S. Farm Act which provides heavy subsidies to U.S. Exporters enabling them to compete with Thai exporters.

The Board of Trade said Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnes in January/March, down from 1.29 mln a year ago.     It said the export decline was partly due to the reluctance of Thai traders to accept all foreign orders as world prices did not rise in line with firming domestic prices.     The board said, however, that Thailand may export more rice later this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East and Asia, due to lower production in many drought affected African countries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burma and Pakistan.

Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had already bought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn and soybeans.     This meant the country would buy from the United States nearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports of such commodities this year, they said.     The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs, accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrain exports and cut export financing, the statement said.

Western agricultural experts believe the crop could still be good but heavy winterkill will make it difficult to reach the 1987 grain target of 232 mln tonnes. The 1986 crop was 210 mln.

The official, who declined to be named, said the company under a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7 and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only 126,000 tonnes altogether.     The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrs per tonne for every delayed day according to a document signed by both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, he told Reuters.     ""If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view,"" the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at a cabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added.     A pro-government Bengali daily ""Dainik Janata"" reported today that Continental Grain could face a penalty of 200 mln taka (6.49 mln dlrs) for alleged failure to maintain shipment schedule.     The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi Ahmed Choudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh government for an extension of the shipment period because loading of wheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and a faulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yet granted the extension, he said.     Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had gone up after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financial loss to the company.     He said he was not ""officially informed"" of the move to impose a penalty, although he was ""not totally unaware of it.""     Continental Grain officials in New York declined to comment.

23,"FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE The U.S. Department of Agriculture's forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.     The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers' Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks.     However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.     The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.     This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.     ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC official said.     Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.     He said, however, that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.     The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.     Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.     It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares, down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,1
24,"ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT The Zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.     However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal, were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions.     Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.     Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.     In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.     President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.     The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity program.     Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after today's deadline.

The government welcomed a decision by the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.     The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat, fresh vegetables and medicines.

1,"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS Commodities from gold to grains to cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability.     Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.     A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co., in New York.     The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value, and despite reports of intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.     Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term direction of the currency markets.     ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If they do, it's not evident.""     ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be.     ""One way or another, we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.     ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's happening,"" he said.     The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.     At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of Dominick and Dominick.     The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton posted broad gains.     Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand.     After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.     Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately higher.     Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field work to market animals.  Reuter &#3;",0,1,0,0,0

5,"DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS A prolonged dry spell has damaged 111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials said.     They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing conditions continued until next month.     Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry spell.     Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice), representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8 mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.     About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at 170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.     Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total thus the damage is considered negligible.     In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.      The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to 320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued.

7,"AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS Australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.     ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets,"" he said in a statement.     Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.     However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures.     He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.     If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.     ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production,"" Condon said.     ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry,"" he added.

15,"LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected.      But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open its markets.     ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but they are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.     U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month, they said.     ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when he visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.     Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.     A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.     Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.     He cited the example of a California company which transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal, he said.     U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.     Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry.     The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And Japanese officials have said.    Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries, but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.    Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies, including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in Geneva.

He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japan had a large export balance, not just with the U.S. But with other countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pct self-sufficient in one product.     Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agriculture minister Mutsuki Kato, Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked for total liberalisation of the rice market in Japan.     Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice.     ""We want to have some access in the rice market,"" he said.     He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutter were disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He told reporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to open negotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japan on rice.     Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of rice self-sufficiency.

18,"LYNG WARNS U.S. TRADE SITUATION IS EXPLOSIVE (RPT) U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Japanese government officials do not seem to understand that protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Could lead to an explosive situation and protectionist legislation.     Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng said protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarmingly during the last six months.     ""It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive. We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory laws which would have very serious consequences for other countries, especially Japan,"" Lyng told reporters.     Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislation appeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision, requiring retaliation against countries which have trade surpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said.     U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a Washington Democrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that the Gephardt provision will be approved by the House when trade legislation is taken up later this month.     Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive the volatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress is increasingly unpredictable, he said.     ""The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact that patience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. I cannot emphasise that enough,"" Lyng said.     In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato yesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import quotas on beef and citrus.     Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S. Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response in Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has been introduced in both the House and Senate.     Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products since 1964, especially grains.     He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited land area, is concerned about maintaining some level of self-sufficiency in food for national security reasons.     But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would not necessarily weaken Japanese agriculture.     Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments of farm products as it did in 1973.

Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at seven pct, it said.     Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and 330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months following a huge increase in soymeal imports.     Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.     EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed, sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record 5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year.

5,"NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG The Soviets have not indicated an urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told Reuters.     In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.     ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it. There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy).""     When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""     The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit.     ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about,"" Lyng said.     ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.     Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.     The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement.     ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union, but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that. These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""

8,"LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal.     ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal. It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.     Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.     Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.     The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.     However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic.     Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position.""     ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say.""     Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations  started.     ""All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.     The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he said.

10,"ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT The American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation.     ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps.""     ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,"" he said.     The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory.     The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then.     The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax.     The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams said.     The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.     U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added.     Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,1,0
11,"EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA The European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC officials said.     Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat, fish and cereals by-products.     But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the officials said.     The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.     Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat, saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500 tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.     Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.     The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).     But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership.     Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada.     Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation.     Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.

The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes the plan would be adopted this year.     A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.     Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package.     ""I don't see this as a trade issue.

Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.     The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.     But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal ""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.

8,"COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET Consuming countries, chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving, a Reuter survey showed.     They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts. Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses, have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.     Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey showed.     The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.     The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.     A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.     Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.     Consumers and a small group of producers argued that ""objective criteria"" should be used to define export quota shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and, although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today, delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.     International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.     An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups, made up of governments with advice from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.     The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives, citing the lack of widespread support.     U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.     ""We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"" official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts.     The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries, the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.     U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.     Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case.     Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from 70,000.     Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London, ""Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality, if there was full participation by producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously.""     But Baron added, ""No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them.""     Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries. But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for ""intellectual honesty"" and ""objective criteria"" have grown.     British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.     It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K. Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be.     A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.     A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation, particularly regarding stocks.     Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta: ""These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith."" Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements.     ""The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work,"" Martinez Cuenca said.     The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200 contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900 contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.     At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat speculative position limits unchanged.     ""Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT for speculative interest,"" Michael Braude, president of the Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.     A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing to raise CBT's limits.     KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to attract large speculators.     The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.

The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell that followed a period of warm weather.     He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.     Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.     The report said that since much of the early growth in February was from late seeding rather than from normal development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say.     The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.     However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which would aid recovery.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,1

In a field report, the officer said indications were that winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared with 38,000 last year.     He said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north.     Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present, he added.     The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well developed plants and for winter barley.     Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing water occurred in the fields.

The average trade guess for 1987 planted corn acreage was 66.06 mln acres, ranging from 60.7 to 69.0 mln, all well below the 76.67 mln planted last year due to improved incentives by the USDA for farmers to retire acres.

The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks are ""the first report we've had for a long time that shows any optimism for anybody,"" said John ""Bud"" Frazier, grain analyst and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.     ""I'm really excited about it,"" Frazier said.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.     The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels of wheat, all below trade guesses.     Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade panel to discuss the reports.     Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five cents a bushel ""if the bell rang right now.""     ""We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and soybeans) than we thought we had,"" he said, noting that hog and poultry production is up.     ""We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"" said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and 15 pct in the preceding quarter.     However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed consumption.     She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came in southeastern states, where yields are usually low.     ""We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's opening,"" she said.     Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from last year's 8.25 billion bushels.     ""We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce stocks,"" she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year at 6.7 billion bushels.     Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long term, ""But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down to where we could start rebuilding prices.""     Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more soybeans.     The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.     ""There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law we're working under today, and this report should reinforce that,"" Frazier said.

He said production costs had risen to 40 pct of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment had caused the area of irrigated land to fall.     Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978.     He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.     He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles, rather than the essentials.

37,"U.S., ARGENTINA SETTLE SOYPRODUCT CASE - YEUTTER U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a  case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry alleging unfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry.     Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late yesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a trade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week.     Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers, Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and products, U.S. and Argentine officials said.     The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association alleged Argentina, through differential export taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.     The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section 301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and represented an unfair trade practice.     Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S. government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentina took steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States would consider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentine officials said.     An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for removal of the Argentine export taxes.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,1,0

8,"U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said.     However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future.     ""The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"" an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ""But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.""     Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week.     But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months.     ""I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process,"" the aide to Lyng said.     ""An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"" said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program.     An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets.     But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time.     The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.     In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm, basic, factual economics.""     Another USDA official said there was ""not even an informal suggestion or hint"" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms.     USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop.     Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits.

11,"FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil.     The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year.     Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number.     However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months.     U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.     Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today.     ""Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds),"" one CBT crush trader said.     ""But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added.     As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days.     The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.     With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.     A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said.     Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,1,0

14,"INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW Indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.     Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia""s agricultural performance.     The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987.     The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks.     ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,"" the report says.     ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels.""     Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines.     The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields.     The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types.     The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices.     Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says.     But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.     The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand.     The report said that Indonesia""s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984.     The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump.  REUTER &#3;",1,1,1,1,1

It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target.     Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and 890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.     Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988.     China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the U.S. Provides the rest, it said.     ""This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them,"" it said.     Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.

The deadline for a final determination is March 7.     U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case, Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.     Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

27,"U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said.     The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, ""but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions"" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said      While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments.     Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and ""quarantine"" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said.       Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.     ""We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers,"" Jim Miller, president of NAWG said.

In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.     ""This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market,"" Yeutter said.     Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT.

""I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal,"" Yeutter said.

The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement.     He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire.     Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.     ""The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"" he said.     ""The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time,"" he said.

Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Association's first vice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administration would not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers and processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation.     U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter to EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover more than agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennett said.     The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA) delegations will meet top West German government officials today and tomorrow to lobby for support.     Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seem to have taken a hardline view on the issue.     ""Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their advantage economically, but that is not correct because we would hit back,"" NSPA chairman Jack Reed said.     This step would be very expensive for all and no one would emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said.     Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybean industry view the EC proposal as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

2,"OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies.     Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries, were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified.     The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent, PSE.     The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged 83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pct and the United States 48.2 pct.     For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and the U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC 13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.     In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S. Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC and 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.     For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.     The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and Japan, the sources said.     Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD work.     Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May.     Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a  basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva.     British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.     He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture.     However, the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials familiar with the study said.     The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.     In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.     For example, the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49 pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.     French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale, citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC.     However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.     Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation.     The updated calculations, which may take several months to complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S. subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.     U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials added.

5,"U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT A statement yesterday by Secretary of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.     They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action.     In response to a query on what the State Department's position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.     The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.     Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union, grain industry sources said.     Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel, while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.     ""I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the Soviet Union,"" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.     ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else,"" Shultz told the farm leaders. ""That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets,"" he said.     If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP, it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.     National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary's comments.     ""His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP,"" an official with the wheat group said.     The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that ""there is significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.""     In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the officials said.     An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets, said that the Shultz comments ""are consistent with what he (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,"" but said they don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.     Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.     But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.     ""If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is potentially a positive development,"" a commodity source said.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1
6,"EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.     They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia.     The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's cereals management committee today.     The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries.     The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them.     The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.     The request will be considered at the committee's next meeting, the commission sources said.     Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of maize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time, the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.     ""We need some kind of market loan,"" he added.     The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.     Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA, but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.     USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a ""dilemna"" which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any changes, are under consideration.     In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment, or a direct payment program.     Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.     ""Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,"" Haggard said.     However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.     He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating.     The Reagan administration has given ""mixed signals"" on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.     While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.     The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois.     Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.     Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.     Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,1,0
8,"USDA REPORTS CORN SOLD TO USSR, TAIWAN The U.S. Agriculture Department said private U.S. exporters reported new sales of 900,000 tonnes of corn to the Soviet Union and 350,000 tonnes of corn switched from previously announced unknown destinations to the USSR.     The corn is for delivery during the 1986/87 marketing year and under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Long Term Grain Supply Agreement, the USDA said.     The department said exporters also reported corn sales of 143,000 tonnes for delivery to Taiwan, with 56,000 tonnes for shipment in the 1986/87 season and the balance for shipment in the 1987/88 year.

9,"SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS Secretary of State George Shultz has decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.     ""Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do,"" the official said.     If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, he said, ""Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but he won't go to the President and voice his objections.""     In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers, the State Department said, ""Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.     The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program.""     Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow, the State Department official said.     ""Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.""     USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.     The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring U.S. prices down to competitive levels.     The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the State Department source said.     ""What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world,"" he said.     The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.     Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.     ""Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a foregone conclusion,"" the State Department official said.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

OFFICIAL SAYS FATE OF VEG OIL TAX UNCERTAIN Whether the European Community's Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain, an EC official said.     ""It is very far from certain that it will go through,"" Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, told reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association.     Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West Germany has opposed it in the past.

11,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern, &lt;Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather forecasting service, said.     Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government officials and meteorologists said.     Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.     Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.     Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for over 20 years, the paper said.     The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers, it added.     This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.     Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February.     The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.     Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters     In Australia, concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local Meteorological Bureau officials said.     For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.     Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino, they said.     Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.     Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event' was unique.     The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982/83, it said.     El Nino, Spanish for ""Christ Child"" because it appears around Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds, meteorologists said.     The winds, strengthened by El Nino's ""pump"" effect, raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.     When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.     One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.     The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather said.     China, where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the May-September rains, it said.     The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.     In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end.     In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually occur between April and June, although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.  REUTER &#3;",0,0,1,0,1

Several top government officials told the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association delegations there was no reason for American producers and processors to pay for EC agriculture, the spokesman said.     European agriculture was facing severe problems, but both the Community and the U.S. Should work closely within the framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he said.

""We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing,"" said Bob Sindt, USDA assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations.     U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.     But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.     ""If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this,"" he said.     Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system.     ""We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy,"" he said. ""If we become convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate adjustments will be made.""     Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA's price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates.     He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.     Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums.     He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease.     The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.     When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted the idea.     He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be emptied by the end of March.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
16,"CONCERN OVER ""EL NINO"" IN PERU - USDA REPORT There are heightened fears that ""El Nino"" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a field report.     Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area, flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.     However, it said official sources still believe that this year's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.     EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific.     The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production.     Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle.     Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists, it said.     However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, and slow the decline in sugar production, it said.     If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry could receive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in 1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.     Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.     It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March, April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest.     ""There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino -- only time will tell,"" the report said.  Reuter &#3;",1,1,1,0,0
17,"ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER The Soviet Union's winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said.     Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the EF Hutton publication ""Global Crop News,"" said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat, from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.     ""Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,"" she said. ""But it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.""     Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.     The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops, she said.     However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage.     The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia, Martell said.     She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.     Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.     Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports.     However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the 1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.     Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.     In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only 24 pct of that total.     While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87 was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.

Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50 cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains.     Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42 billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.

In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers.

They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet imports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought one mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.     In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimate for 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.     ""That was business already done, for all practical purposes,"" said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson, reflecting similar statements made by other analysts.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,1
15,"USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department official said.     ""They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no reason now to think they won't this year,"" he told Reuters.     ""They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers from all sources at this point,"" the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.     This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for the first time in 15 years.     A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's recent interest.     Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan, and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the official said.     ""The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"" and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. ""As soon as they need corn, they'll buy it,"" he added.     USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.     The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U.S. market again.     ""There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now,"" the official said.     However, the situation in wheat is ""a different story,"" he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.

20,"VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.     Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.     ""Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils,"" Balletto said.     Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.     He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.     Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said, disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.     ""If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop,"" he said.     ""This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds,"" Balletto said.     Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies, he said.     World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes, compared with 25.4 mln last year.     The increase should result from lower disappearance, as production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7 mln last year, he said.     World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said, while production of other oilseeds was lower.     Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States, he said.     Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S. stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.     The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes, about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.     Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased 13.1 mln tonnes.     ""During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1 mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U.S. loan program.""     ""Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.     For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U.S. loan program.     ""Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U.S. loan rate.""     The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.

Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration, ""should be seriously considered"" because a refusal to do so could ""play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls"" placed on production.     However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted.     The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill, Dole said.     Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U.S. relations with that country.     Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive prices.     The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize.     Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.     The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes ""are not going anywhere"" this year, Dole said, singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.     Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he didn't see any change.

Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production, but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total.     A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.

Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces.     Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.     Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco.     Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered.     Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate.     The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.     Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area.     Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily.     Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.     The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago.     Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather.     Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes.     Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago.

""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"" one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.     Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to 10 over July futures.     Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light, with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell, dealers said.     Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half of the Midwest.     Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.     Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has already moved to a premium over the August through October months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also move to a July premium later this month, they added.

As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.

8,"NO YIELD DAMAGE YET IN U.S. CORN, BEANS - USDA The U.S. corn and soybean crops are in mostly good condition and have not suffered any yield deterioration from recent hot, dry weather, Agriculture Department and private weather and crop analysts said.     ""I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet,"" Norton Strommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. ""The (corn and soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and is progressing ahead of normal, which is good,"" he said.     Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areas sparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing new crop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrs per bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs.     ""This rally is amazing,"" a private crop analyst said. ""Corn, soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition.""     The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm, dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed up development of the crop, which will help the crop better cope with stress later in its more critical growing period.     ""What this weather will do is simply push the crop towards rapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on the subsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go through a little stress early on,"" Strommen said.     Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape in most growing areas.     Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn and soybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until July and August.     But because of its early development this year, Strommen said the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction period by the first of July.     ""Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn or soybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But the dryness still has to last for another two to three weeks,"" an analyst said.     Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several more weeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, crop analysts agreed.     August and September are the critical yield-producing months for soybeans, Strommen said.     ""The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply survive during May, June and July until the August rains which determine the crop,"" a crop analyst said.     Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growing areas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure that there will not be problems later.     Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weather forecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in much of the corn belt.

9,"HOT WEATHER PUSHES CBT GRAINS TO NEW HIGHS Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, with more forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs today on the Chicago Board of Trade.     Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the 30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts for delivery after this year's fall harvest. All months set life-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs a bushel.     ""The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter than normal for some time out,"" said David Bartholomew, assistant vice president for Merrill Lynch. ""We have probably gone as high as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how to measure the euphoria level.""     Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week, posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limit in new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.     Corn futures set contract highs in March through September, with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4 dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved harvest conditions in the southern Midwest.     The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean plants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit young plants by encouraging the development of deep root systems, Bartholomew said.     European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to active buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean orders went unfilled at the close, traders said.     After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not suffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.     Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the dollar, which can depress prices by making grains more expensive for foreign buyers.     But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's COMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle steady.     Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the weather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of inflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures, which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S. trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.     A USDA report released after trading said the number of cattle being fed in seven major producing states was above levels expected by traders. Traders said the report would probably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.     USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52 mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of trade forecasts.     A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May, up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off 93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.     Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hot weather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,1,0

He said a rise in world prices had made the Uruguayans reluctant to ship any soybeans at the agreed price of 226.56 U.S. Dlrs per tonne.     The Uruguayans agreed to supply part of the shipment after the Taiwan committee threatened last week to cancel the order, but they postponed delivery to July 1-20 from the original June 5-25, the committee spokesman said.     Government sources in Montevideo confirmed that Uruguayan grain exporting firms would ask Taiwan to reconsider prices on the soybeans but said the government would not intervene in the dispute.     ""The deal was agreed to between two private companies, without any participation whatsoever from the Uruguayan government,"" Uruguyan Agriculture Ministry spokesman Andres Bonino said.     He added, ""Uruguay is not going to export 70,000 tonnes of soybeans, since total production this year has been lower than that figure.""     The contract called for the Uruguayans to deliver the 70,000 tonnes in two shipments between June 5 and August 10.     Taiwan's ambassador in Montevideo, Henry Wang, told reporters, ""Both countries are finishing details to arrive at a satisfactory price.""     He said the price would be ""very advantageous (for Uruguay) because it will be above the international price.""     Taiwan bought some 36,000 tonnes of soybean last year, making it Uruguay's biggest customer for the oilseed.

14,"JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO LIBERALISE FARM MARKET Japan has no plans to liberalise its farm markets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price of farm products at home and overseas, Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato said.     He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticism of Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.     But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade talks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.     Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme example of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S. Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to imports except in emergency.     Kato said Japanese farmers should however ""shed some blood,"" to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.     His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice Price Council at which the government advisory body will discuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.     Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent summit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in Venice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May.     Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term need to cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.     Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protect producers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billion dlrs a year to support producer prices and on its export enhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spends only 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides the world's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy per farm family was several times lower than in the United States.     Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves in U.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to prevent farm trade issues between the two countries from becoming a factor increasing protectionism in the United States.

The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef cattle raising, Ministry officials said.     Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87 against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were 217,554 tonnes against 224,101.     Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.     The officials said corn imports rose because the world surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in 1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.     Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from 18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.     Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.     The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.     Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against 528,152 a year earlier.

Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""     The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.     The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked and the subsidies are a waste of money.     Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers, exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.     Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.     The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country would save money by importing the commodity.     However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.

18,"BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS U.S. House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.     The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.     The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.     The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior Congressional aides told Reuters.     Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings.     Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.     House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.     But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims.     Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program, ARP, levels for wheat and corn.     However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.     Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity.     Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.     Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion but not enough, they said.     Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.     This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0

""There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly nothing damaging,"" said Charles Stichler, an extension agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West Texas.     Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.    Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95 cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25 cents.     ""What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and when that happens, everybody sees it,"" said Dale Mohler, a senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.     Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.     The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. ""That's hurricane force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the West Texas area, probably less than five pct,"" Mohler said.     ""No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been worse,"" Mohler said.     About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.     The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about 95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.  Reuter &#3;",0,1,0,0,0

Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S. farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they approve of the proposal.     The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.     Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs.     Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his ""Family Farm Act.""     -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture.     -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would increase overall revenue from exports.     This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices.     Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable.     -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from high farm product prices.     Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J. Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct Quaker Oats.     -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.     He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp. grain stocks for three years.     Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a ""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.     -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current farm program.

12,"AUSTRALIA ATTACKS U.S. GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION Australia accused the U.S. of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade.     Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.     ""Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture,"" the Australian delegation said in a statement.     ""The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,"" Arnott told the meeting.     Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for ""dubious protective measures"" by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports.     He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs. This covered imports of dairy products, peanuts, cotton and sugar.     Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the GATT, told Reuters: ""These charges have been made since the very beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT"".     ""We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs. We can negotiate them all,"" Samuels added.     Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.

13,"HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or ""de-coupling,"" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources said.     The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.     The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.     It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee, the sources said.     Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.     Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill, committee staffers said.     The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.     Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.     Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.     An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary.     Major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.     But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it should be extended to other crops.     There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.     Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.     Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill.     ""Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the timing,"" a congressional staff member said.     Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.     Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.     Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and 151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from the previous week's combined sales, it said.     Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by 30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.     Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week average.

Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4 times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less than the four week average.     Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown destinations.

18,"HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later, Congressional sources said.     The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat.     This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987 wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.     Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.     Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0/92.     The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92, and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.     Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0/92.     ""The timing (of the proposal) is off,"" said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member.     However, several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package.     Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs.     A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings.     A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5 billion dlrs over five years.     Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.     Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains.     If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1
19,"BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS Brazil's recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.     The developing world's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.     ""That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation,"" Aldo Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics, said.     Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets, but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable.     ""Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates,"" Roldan said.     The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs.     But he added: ""They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels.""     Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance.     Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence.     ""Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations, which others wanted changed,"" one senior coffee dealer said.     The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer.     Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the dealer said.     ""If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"" he said.     New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.     President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas.     Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. ""They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"" according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.     Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop. ""Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops,"" he said.     The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields.     ""We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,"" Loewy said.     Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.     Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.     Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.     He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan.     ""We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export,"" Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.     Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation.     He said the debt situation was a major consideration. ""The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage,"" he added.     Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said it would not make a big difference.     On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital.     Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will give it little room to stretch exports, they said.     Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of surplus. ""Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it,"" one analyst said.     ""If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would collapse and they can't afford to do that,"" she added.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,1,0

30,"U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION Advocates of a 0/92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional sources said.     The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.     An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.     Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat, it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally, they said.    If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week, sources said.    English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.     Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill, they said.     Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.     Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.     An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill, but to be fair to all crops.     Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land, economists said.

A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85 cts per bushel.     ""This was cleary a political decision,"" Hall said. ""The amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant.""     The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and that American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government payments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.     Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack U.S. farm programs.     The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of U.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0

The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cents a bushel.

""We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year,"" he said in a statement.     He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq.     In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.     Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB.     The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.     However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.     Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.     But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available.     In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop.

Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.     Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.     Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings.     A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.     Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.     It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders.     Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.

Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he will not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. ""We will urge that they consider sharing their rice market,"" he said.

""We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame, but we are locked into this,"" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains. ""We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.""     Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week.     Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill -- only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under the current bill.     It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill, he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.     A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.     Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point, he said.     ""I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,"" Glickman said at the hearing.     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term 0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.     Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.     ""I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but we can at least move in that direction,"" Boschwitz said.     Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers' dependency on the government, he said.     A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.     Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.     But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.

The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with U.S. agriculture officials.     Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in light of a Soviet trade official's statement that the previous purchase had satisfied near-term needs.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
27,"U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP SEEN 10 TO 12 MLN ACRES Grain traders and analysts look for a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA's conservation reserve program, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today.     The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted, they said.     Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.     However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total corn production will be minimal, they added.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
28,"USSR HEAVY BUYERS OF YUGOSLAV CORN-U.S. REPORT The Soviet Union has been a heavy buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.     Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U.S. official.     In a report dated March 10, the official said that about 800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.     An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.     Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.     Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier estimates of 150,000, the official said.     The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year, he said.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
29,"NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING A greater than anticipated need, competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials said.     As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.     First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.     A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.     Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.     Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.     ""Significant downside potential"" still exists for the Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.     ""If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period,"" he said.     Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying.     U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet sources said.     ""This price difference makes American corn competitive,"" Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union, told Reuters.     Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.     Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.     In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
1,"SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.     Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.     Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.     Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer.     Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S. Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer.     But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer, while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility.     Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.     Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible, are saying they would not rule one out.     Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks.     Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials.     Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S. Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month.     Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.     Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.     As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price.     Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices far above world market prices.     The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism, grain trade sources said.     Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were ""chortling"" because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U.S. housewives.     The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.     In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.     However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer.     Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.     Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets.     That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the agreement.     Under the accord, which began in January, third countries were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as 300,000 tonnes of sorghum.     However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured that almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.

5,"HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP Fresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said.     They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops.     The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.     The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.     The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.     In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay.     In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.     The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.     Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.     The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.     Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces.     The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.     The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.     The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather permitting.     Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production.     The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.     The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers' targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.     The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.     The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.     The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.     These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.     The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said.     Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further.     The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season.     Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,1,0

8,"ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U.S. WHEAT The Soviet Union would likely be more interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S. wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.     Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.     ""Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond to,"" Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness education conference here. But if there are too many constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.     Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put Soviet Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels, Moscow would likely buy more, he said.     ""If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I expect they'll take it,"" said Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.     McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a subsidy offer.

14,"U.S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER The U.S. House Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.     The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.     In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, Congressional sources said.     The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988.     The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion now.     Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate.     The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration make an offer, but urges such action.     The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.     Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.     Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.     Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New Zealand and Ireland.     The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S. beef imports.     Other miscellaneous amendments included:     -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports.     -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.     -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.     -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a Canadian countervailing duty case this year.     -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.     -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

16,"AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.     ""Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications,"" the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.     ""Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia,"" it said.     The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.     Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.     It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping.     Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing, it said.     The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat.     The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment.     ""It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored,"" it said.     For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW) might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly, southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong, in Victoria.     Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.     The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential, although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained.     An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

28,"U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD Sharp cuts this year in U.S. planted acreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture Department and industry commodity analysts said.     ""The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole supply/demand picture could finally be getting more in balance,"" a USDA analyst said.     The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated that U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annual acreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln acres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program, bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres, almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.     Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will probably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in stocks, analysts said.     ""It's a substantially different story from last year when we added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile,"" Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.     Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here, McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely translate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields, final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.     McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in 1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting in a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile of 5.45 billion bushels.     ""To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we're at least in a holding pattern,"" George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for Pillsbury said.     Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of 1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to ""significantly less"" domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.     USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage and said wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not increase. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, next year's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.     ""We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now, so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage reductions, that would be an improvement,"" an Agriculture Department wheat analyst said.     Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be the smallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lower final production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to 100 mln bushels, analysts said.     As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in the conservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programs will be more effective because they will force more high producing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.

Processors dropped spot Chicago corn basis bids three cents after covering most of the April needs this week, with river corn basis bids following CIF Gulf corn values lower.     The surge in PIK-and-roll also pressured corn futures, with May settling today down three cents per bushel at 1.58-1/2 dlrs, near the contract low of 1.49-1/4 dlrs.

38,"PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.     No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said.     Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable.     The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops.     Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds.     The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said.     Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln.     He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly.     The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.     The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a ""strategic reserve"" target of two mln tonnes.     Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.     The government wants to keep an extra ""safety margin"" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said.     The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.     Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.     Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.     The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.     Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.     Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

40,"EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND The European Commission's decision to release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.     Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage, pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes were granted.     The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.     The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission. There has been growing concern that rising internal prices, triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in interior markets.     The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month. The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and June.     News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged.     Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market. However, some traders believe these figures are overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores.     A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59 mln tonnes.     Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.     This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August.     The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984/85 season.     Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.     The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders said.     Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.     The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season.

The action increases Morocco's cumulative fiscal year 1987 program for wheat under GSM-103 to 75.0 mln dlrs.     The credit terms extended for exports under the program must be in excess of three years but no more than seven years to eligible for credit coverage.

11,"U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.     Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.     Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.     The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments.     Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January.     National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.     Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate.     The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said.     Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said.     The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
12,"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne.      For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said.     Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said.     In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.     But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90.     The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said.  Reuter &#3;",0,0,0,0,1

If the reports are confirmed, China's major export destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said.

The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains.     EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said.     The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.     The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.     It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year.     The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said.     Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.     But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said.  Reuter &#3;",1,0,0,0,0
19,"CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets.     Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.     Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.     With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances.     An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said.     Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added.     Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton.     One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

21,"TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST Torrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May.     The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.     Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.     No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.     Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.     Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.     Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures.     The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area.     Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares.     Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest.     Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.     Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.     Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.     Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.

Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.     The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.     Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme.     If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments.

The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers.     ""They're all lower,"" he said. ""This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.""     Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.     Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.     If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.     The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet.     Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.

""We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices,"" he said in an interview.     Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices.     ""We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault,"" Melnikov said.     Article I in the agreement states that ""purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.""     ""The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?"" he said.     The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.     Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.     ""If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered,"" he said.     Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.
