\section{Conclusion}
In this study, structural SVM was used for multi-label classification of Reuters-21578 dataset, where only five classes: corn, cotton, rice, soybean, and wheat were chosen. 70\% of the datasets were used as training and the remaining 30\% were used as test data. The performance of the classification was evaluated using Hamming Loss.

From the observations, it can be concluded that structural SVM has loss percentage approximately 6\% in training and approximately 13\% in testing data, even when number of vocabulary size is small.
