Machine learning methods usually solve classification and regression problems with single output. To solve problems that include complex output spaces, structured output prediction methods such as structural SVM are used. Multi-label classification problem involves predicting zero or more mutually non-exclusive class labels. Therefore, this problem has complex output space. The pystruct implementation of 1-slack structural SVM is used to perform multi-label classification of text documents. The performance evaluation shows small loss even for small vocabulary size.
